CPU Spy

(c) 2011 Brandon Valosek <bvalosek@gmail.com>

Simple Android app for viewing the time the CPU spends in each frequency state,
as well as the current kernel information.

=== TO INSTALL ===
The latest stable version is available on the Android Market:

   https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bvalosek.cpuspy

=== TO BUILD ===
To download the repo and build the APK signed with the SDK debug keys:
   git clone git://github.com/storm717/cpuspy.git
   cd cpuspy
   maven package android:deploy

This requires a properly setup Maven environment with the Android JAR files in
a local repo, see https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer for
more information.

=== INCOMPATIBLE PHONES ===
The following phones do not seem to expose the necessary file to read in
states:

HTC Sensation XE, LG G2x
